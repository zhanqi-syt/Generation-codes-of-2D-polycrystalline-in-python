## Keywords: 
Sintered silver nanoparticle; CPFEM; constitutive model; initial orientation; grain size
## Introduction
It's a python demo to generate an ABAQUS script to create a finite element model of a 2D polycrystalline microstructure. 
The code is now accessible. You are welcome to use, revise, and update it. 
Hope this helps and many thanks for your continued interest.
